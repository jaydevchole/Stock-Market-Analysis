- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data cleaning and transformation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn**: Predictive modeling
- **Pandas Profiling**: Automated EDA
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive analysis

## 📂 Dataset
- Historical daily stock prices from Feb 7, 2023 to May 5, 2023
- Columns: `Date`, `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`, `Adj Close`, `Volume`, `Ticker`
